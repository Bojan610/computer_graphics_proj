WPF Desktop app

The main goal of the app is to draw a graph of the electricity network. The electricity network graph is drawn based on the Geographic.xml file, which contains the coordinates and information about each of the electricity entities. The program reads information about each entity of the selected xml file, including their coordinates, and then draws the appropriate graphical shape on the map.
